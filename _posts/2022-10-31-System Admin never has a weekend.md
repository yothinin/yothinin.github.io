Since I worked as a system administrator parallel with a programming job, I have worked to do more, I never have a weekend or holiday.

I try to use every time that is possible to relax by traveling, taking photos, or reading books.

Most of the problems will occur after I launch the program or set up the network, or config the server, somewhere next time by unpredictability.

Hence I do my job and response to the problem all time, for twenty years ago.

In my experience, I have had a call from my customer at any time in 24 hours to fix the problem. 

Now, I look forward to some people who work in the same of me, they are quite not serious, they have worked only on working dates, not weekends. It is not wrong, but the business must go on.

The mindset of the new generations now they want to work less for more income. I need it like that too, but network engineers or system admins are also still out of hours working, if the system goes down on your day off, you will be called to fix it.

I was working here for a long time, and it is time to leave, I nearly retired to live in the countryside, and I have anxiety about who will work instead for me. Can they hold my job to support the business to continue without a mistake?
