Since I worked as a system administrator parallel with a programming job, I have worked to do more, I never had a weekend or holiday.

I try to use every time that is possible to relax by traveling, taking photos, or reading books.

Most of the problems will occur after we launch or update the program or set up the network, configure the server, disasters, or come from the providers, somewhere next time by unpredictability.

Hence, I do my job and respond to the problem all the time, twenty years ago.

In my experience, I have had a call from my customer at any time in 24 hours to fix the problem.

Now, I look forward to more people who work in the same field. They are not quite serious, they worked only on working dates, not weekends. It is not wrong, but the business must go on.

The mindset of the new generation now is that they want to work less for more income. I need it like that too, but network engineers or system admins are also still out of working hours. If the system goes down on your day off, you will be called to fix it.

I worked here for a long time, and it is time to leave. I have nearly retired to live in the countryside, and I have anxiety about who will work instead of me. Can they hold on to my job to support the business to continue without a mistake?
