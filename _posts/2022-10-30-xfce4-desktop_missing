Hello, guy!

This morning I use the command in Linux to remove LibreOffice, after that, all xfce4-desktop was missing.

First, I reboot my Orange Pi device, and the system allows me to login into text mode only, no GUI.

after I log in to the terminal I use this command to install the xfce4-desktop:

```
sudo apt install xfce4-desktop
```
