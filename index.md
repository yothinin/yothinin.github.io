Welcome, 
First, I apologize for my poor English, and you don't hesitate to suggest me. I create this repository to keep my documents or opinions about the computer job, software development, network, or server configurations. I have been skilled in Linux with Ubuntu since 2007, starting with Ubuntu 7.04 until 18.04 LTS on the server edition and 20.04 LTS on the desktop edition. Now I have changed to Debian both the server and desktop.

Why do I have changed?

The main reason is Ubuntu has much more loading and slow for me, in the fact that I have changed to a light os like Debian, and the importance it can run on low resource machines such as Arm architects.

Now I use many Orange Pi models such as Pi One to Orange Pi 3 LTS and now I look for the Orange Pi 800 instead of the Raspberry Pi 400, the machine I used to type this document.

In development software, I used Visual FoxPro to create many applications from FP 2.5 for DOS (1992) until Visual FoxPro 6.0 and stop to develop with these tools in 2014 by using PHP and Javascript instead.

Nowadays, I change my ways of developing software from a web base to Desktop Applications based on Linux environments, by using GCC C and Gtk+ 3.0, and then I will migrate to Gtk 4.0 in the next.

Why I use C not C++ because I like C syntax much more than C++ and I love Gtk more than Qt, I love Debian more than Ubuntu because it is very simple to use and stable for me and my jobs.

At the last, I want to say I don't an expert but I would like to be :D (I just joking!). I try to learn more to use it and I know some things I want to jot down for me and other newbie guys. If you're exporting and see any things wrong please correct me. PLEASE!, THANK YOU...
